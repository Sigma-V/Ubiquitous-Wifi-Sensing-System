# Ubiquitous Wifi Sensing System | Summer IP'24



This repository contains all the work for the project ' Ubiquitous Wifi Sensing System ' which was undertaken as an Independent Project (Research Work) under Prof. Mukulika Maitiy , IIIT - D during Summer Term 2024

**Description:**

Thr project aims to develop a novel human activity recognition system using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) signals. The project is expected to achieve real-time activity recognition with an accuracy greater than 98% by utilization of LSTMs and TCN models. The research aimed to create a streamlined probabilistic framework for achieving consistent high-accuracy results across diverse environments
